# apostrophe-fancy-page

This module lets you add custom properties to "regular pages" on your [Apostrophe](http://github.com/punkave/apostrophe-sandbox) CMS site. With this module, a page can have subpages and yet also have custom properties in the page settings dialog, including "joins" with other page types and snippet types, without writing extra JavaScript code.

See the [Apostrophe documentation: fancy pages](http://apostrophenow.org/tutorials/pages/index.html) for details.
